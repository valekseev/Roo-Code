# VSIX Package Details

## Version: 3.20.3-v6

Built on: 2025-01-16 19:45:00 UTC

## Key Changes in v6:

- **Changed +5m to +10m button** for longer timeout extensions
- **Fixed color transitions**: Red at 5 seconds, orange at 20 seconds, blue above 20 seconds
- **Fixed timeout bar disappearing issues**: Bar now clears when tasks complete or are cancelled
- **Improved timeout management**: Added task completion and abortion listeners to clear timeouts
- Debug indicator updated to show "ðŸš€ Roo Code v6 - Ready for timeout testing"

## All Features:

- Always-visible +1m, +10m, X buttons (no warning condition required)
- No percentage display in timeout progress bar
- Smooth color transitions based on remaining time (not percentage)
- Automatic timeout clearing when tasks finish or are manually cancelled
- Progress bar should continue smoothly during extensions (startTime preserved)

## Bug Fixes:

- Timeout bars now disappear when clicking "Close this task and start a new one"
- Timeout bars disappear when tasks complete without timeout
- Added clearAllSubtaskTimeouts() method for comprehensive cleanup
- Task completion and abortion events now properly clear timeouts

## Installation:

```bash
# Navigate to the bin directory
cd /home/ubuntu/src/Roo-Code/bin

## Testing:

1. Look for blue debug message "ðŸš€ Roo Code v6 - Ready for timeout testing" in task header
2. Create a subtask with timeout_seconds parameter
3. Verify timeout counter shows with +1m, +10m, X buttons
4. Test color changes: blue â†’ orange at 20s â†’ red at 5s
5. Test timeout extensions don't reset progress bar
6. Test timeout bar disappears when task completes or is cancelled
7. Check console logs for debugging information
